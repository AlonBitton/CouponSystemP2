## Project Summary

This e-commerce Coupon System project features three client types: Admin, Company, and Customer. Each type has a unique menu, dashboard view, and methods specific to their role. Users can log in as an administrator, company, or customer to access their respective features.
The admin can perform CRUD operations on coupons, customers, and companies.
The company can manage their own coupons by adding, updating, and deleting them.
